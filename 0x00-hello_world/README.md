### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), without the help of Google:

#### General
* Why C programming is awesome
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type ```gcc main.c```
* What is an entry point
* What is ```main```
* How to print text using ```printf```, ```puts``` and ```putchar```
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator ```sizeof```
* How to compile using ```gcc```
* What is the default program name when compiling with ```gcc```
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with ```betty-style```
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the ```main``` function influence the return value of the program

#### Copyright - Plagiarism
* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements
#### C
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* All your files should end with a new line
* A ```README.md``` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use ```system```
* Your code should use the ```Betty style```. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

#### Shell Scripts
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (```$ wc -l file``` should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/bin/bash```

### More Info
#### Betty linter
To run the Betty linter just with command ```betty <filename>```:

* Go to the [Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) repository
* Clone the [repo](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) to your local machine
* ```cd``` into the Betty directory
* Install the linter with sudo ./install.sh
* ```emacs``` or ```vi``` a new file called ```betty```, and copy the script below:

#!/bin/bash
# Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style
# and betty-doc separately on every item.
# Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by
# Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)
```
BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"

if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo "No arguments passed."
    exit 1
fi

for argument in "$@" ; do
    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
done
```

- Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with ```chmod a+x betty```
- Move the ```betty``` file into ```/bin/``` directory or somewhere else in your ```$PATH``` with ```sudo mv betty /bin/```

You can now type ```betty <filename>``` to run the Betty linter!

### Tasks
<details>
<summary>0. Preprocessor</summary>
<code style="white-space:nowrap;">
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output should be saved in the file c

```
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ cat main.c 
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
    return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ export CFILE=main.c
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ ./0-preprocessor 
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ tail c
# 942 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4

# 2 "main.c" 2


# 3 "main.c"

{
 return (0);
}
